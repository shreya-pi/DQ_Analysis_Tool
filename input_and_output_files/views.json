For ASSETMASTER:\n\n```sql\n-- View 1: Duplicate Records\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW assetmaster_duplicate_records AS\nWITH DuplicateCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   SPVNAME, LEGALSTRUCTURE, DEALNAME, SHARECLASSNAME,\n                   ASSETTYPE, DEALTYPE, FUNDTYPE, ASSETCLASS, SECTOR,\n                   MASTERISIN, REGION, STRATEGY, ISLEAD, STATUS\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM ASSETMASTER\n)\nSELECT *\nFROM DuplicateCTE\nWHERE row_num > 1;\n\n-- View 2: Clean View\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW assetmaster_clean_view AS\nWITH CleanCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   SPVNAME, LEGALSTRUCTURE, DEALNAME, SHARECLASSNAME,\n                   ASSETTYPE, DEALTYPE, FUNDTYPE, ASSETCLASS, SECTOR,\n                   MASTERISIN, REGION, STRATEGY, ISLEAD, STATUS\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM ASSETMASTER\n)\nSELECT a.*\nFROM CleanCTE a\nWHERE row_num = 1;\n```\n\n2. For AUMDETAILS:\n\n```sql\n-- View 1: Duplicate Records\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW aumdetails_duplicate_records AS\nWITH DuplicateCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   AUM, RELATIONSHIPMANAGER, EMAIL, RMID,\n                   DEALNAME, ASSETCLASS, DEALTYPE, STRATEGY, REGION, ISIN\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM AUMDETAILS\n)\nSELECT *\nFROM DuplicateCTE\nWHERE row_num > 1;\n\n-- View 2: Clean View\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW aumdetails_clean_view AS\nWITH CleanCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   AUM, RELATIONSHIPMANAGER, EMAIL, RMID,\n                   DEALNAME, ASSETCLASS, DEALTYPE, STRATEGY, REGION, ISIN\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM AUMDETAILS\n)\nSELECT a.*\nFROM CleanCTE a\nINNER JOIN ASSETMASTER am ON a.ISIN = am.ISIN\nINNER JOIN RM_MASTER rm ON a.EMAIL = rm.EMAIL\nWHERE row_num = 1;\n```\n\n3. For MANDATEDETAILS:\n\n```sql\n-- View 1: Duplicate Records\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW mandatedetails_duplicate_records AS\nWITH DuplicateCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   NEWCLIENT, STARTDATE, CLOSINGDATE, CLIENTAGE,\n                   CLIENTPORTFOLIOAGE, GENDERIDENTITY, INDUSTRY,\n                   WEALTHRANGE, RISKLEVEL, OURLEGALENTITY, SCORE,\n                   DEFAULT, PREVIOUSRM, CURRENTRM, STATUS\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM MANDATEDETAILS\n)\nSELECT *\nFROM DuplicateCTE\nWHERE row_num > 1;\n\n-- View 2: Clean View\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW mandatedetails_clean_view AS\nWITH CleanCTE AS (\n    SELECT *,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n               PARTITION BY \n                   NEWCLIENT, STARTDATE, CLOSINGDATE, CLIENTAGE,\n                   CLIENTPORTFOLIOAGE, GENDERIDENTITY, INDUSTRY,\n                   WEALTHRANGE, RISKLEVEL, OURLEGALENTITY, SCORE,\n                   DEFAULT, PREVIOUSRM, CURRENTRM, STATUS\n               ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC\n           ) AS row_num\n    FROM MANDATEDETAILS\n)\nSELECT m.*\nFROM CleanCTE m\nWHERE row_num = 1;\n```\n\nThese views follow the specified pattern:\n1. The duplicate_records views identify all duplicate rows using ROW_NUMBER() > 1\n2. The clean_view views keep only one instance of each unique record (ROW_NUMBER() = 1)\n3. Where applicable, the clean views maintain referential integrity through INNER JOINs\n4. Primary keys and timestamps are excluded from duplicate detection\n5. The most recent record is kept (ORDER BY CREATE_DATE DESC)\n\nThe same pattern should be applied to the remaining tables in the schema, adjusting the PARTITION BY clauses to include all relevant business columns for each table."
