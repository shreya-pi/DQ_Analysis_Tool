üîπ View 1: <table_name>_duplicate_records
	‚Ä¢ Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) and the ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) window function to detect duplicates.
	‚Ä¢ Partition the data using all columns except primary keys, IDs, or timestamp fields, since those might falsely appear unique.
	‚Ä¢ Identify duplicate rows as those where ROW_NUMBER() > 1.

üîπ View 2: <table_name>_clean_view
	‚Ä¢ Create a deduplicated version of the table using a CTE and the ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...) logic.
	‚Ä¢ Retain only rows where ROW_NUMBER() = 1, effectively removing duplicates.
	‚Ä¢ Ensure that this cleaned data maintains referential integrity by applying INNER JOINs with related tables using foreign key constraints (as defined in the schema).
	‚Ä¢ All joins must reflect the relationships described in the schema (e.g., <table_a>.foreign_key = <table_b>.primary_key).

Additional Instructions:
	‚Ä¢ Use descriptive aliases and CTE names for clarity.
	‚Ä¢ Avoid relying on surrogate keys like IDs or timestamps for identifying logical duplicates.
	‚Ä¢ Assume Snowflake or ANSI-compliant SQL unless otherwise specified.
	‚Ä¢ Name the views following this convention:
		‚óã table_name_duplicate_records
          table_name_clean_view
    ‚Ä¢ Ensure both views are generated for **EVERY** table in the schema.

    Using the provided schema:
    
    Analyze and reconstruct the relational data model, identifying all primary keys (PKs), foreign keys (FKs), cardinality, and relational constraints.
    
    While doing so, do not treat any column named ID as a primary key, as these are falsely generated and do not indicate actual uniqueness.
    
    Instead, infer primary keys based on column semantics, naming conventions, or relationships across tables.
    
    Reprint the schema, listing all columns for each table, and clearly mark, if applicable, on the right side of each column:
    Primary Keys (Primary_Key), 
    In case of multiple primary keys, state it as Composite Primary Keys (Composite_Primary_Key) and list all applicable columns, 
    Foreign Keys (Foreign_Key) along with referenced table and column
    
    Ensure that foreign key mappings reflect the relational structure implied by the schema.
    If no primary and/or foreign keys can be inferred, in such cases, set the PK and/or FK as null
    
    Use a clean and readable format. Mention all the columns in each table while generating the response.
